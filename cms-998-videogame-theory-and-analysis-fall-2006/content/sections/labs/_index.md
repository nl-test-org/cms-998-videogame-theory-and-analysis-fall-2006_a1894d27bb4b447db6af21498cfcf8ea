Lab sessions did not follow a concrete week-to-week schedule. The sessions were all student-led and consisted of a series of presentations that they gave on the games they were playing. Most of them played the games live and talked about them.

Lab time was also devoted to some student presentations on game analysis.

Discussion Forum
----------------

In addition to substantial in-class discussion, many conversations took place in an online discussion forum. Here's two samples of such discussions.
